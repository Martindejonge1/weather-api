Weather API
=============================

**Work in Progress** - This Application Programming Interface and its description are both work in progress and can change over time.

The Weather API resolves any location of the world to weather data. 
If you want to get access to the Weather API or have any questions you can contact us [here](https://meteogroup.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/requests/new?ticket_form_id=64951).

You can find more information about the Weather API on it's landing page [https://api.weather.mg](https://api.weather.mg).

For more technical details we provide a documentation on our [GitHub Page](http://meteogroup.github.io/weather-api).

The base of that documentation is an [API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/documentation/) document, which can be found [here](https://github.com/MeteoGroup/weather-api/blob/master/WEATHER-API-BLUEPRINT.md).
You can use that to test your application against the Weather API. 

*We are using that Blueprint in our own automated integration tests and keep it up to date.*
